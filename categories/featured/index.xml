      <description>The Tezos Ithaca upgrade brings several improvements to Tezos&amp;rsquo; consensus model, including deterministic finality and a shift away from a roll-based model to an optimized stake-based model. In this article, we take a deep dive into some of these changes â€“ and what they mean for users. The Ithaca upgrade to the Tezos protocol proposes an improved finality model, Tenderbake, and extends the liquidity baking of the Tezos network. Here we cover how the Ithaca proposal would achieve faster blockchain finality, how it improves on the Granada proposal&amp;rsquo;s Emmy* consensus, and what this all means for Tezos&amp;rsquo; users.</description>
